## My process

After several months without programming, this project was like a warm up to dive again into it. Basic concepts but I needed this to remind me of them.

1. Analyse of the design schema to identify the different sections and how to built the right sections in the HTML file
2. First version of sections and classes
3. Starting of building the style in CSS, from top to bottom
4. Polishing the desktop versionb
5. Building of the mobile version


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
